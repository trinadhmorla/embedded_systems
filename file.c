Porting FreeRTOS to a Cortex-M0 system that boots from SPI NOR flash involves several key steps, especially around setting up the SPI interface early enough to read the application code or data. Here's a breakdown of how to approach this:

üß© Key Concepts
Cortex-M0 Boot Behavior:

Cortex-M0 expects to boot from address 0x00000000, typically mapped to internal flash or remapped to external memory.
If using SPI NOR flash, you need a bootloader or external memory interface to load code into RAM.
SPI NOR Flash:

Common chips: Winbond W25Q series, Macronix MX25, etc.
Interface: SPI (bit-banged or hardware SPI)
Protocol: Usually requires sending commands like READ, FAST_READ, etc.
üõ†Ô∏è Steps to Set Up SPI at Boot Time
1. Minimal Bootloader in ROM or Internal Flash
You need a small bootloader that:

Initializes the SPI peripheral
Reads the FreeRTOS image from SPI NOR flash
Copies it to RAM
Jumps to the FreeRTOS entry point
2. SPI Initialization Code
This must be done before any FreeRTOS code runs. Example (in C, pseudocode):


3. Read from SPI NOR Flash
Use the SPI protocol to read the binary image:


4. Copy Image to RAM
Once the image is read, copy it to a known RAM location and jump to it:


üß™ Testing Tips
Use a debugger to verify SPI reads are correct.
Check that the vector table in the loaded image is valid.
Ensure the memory map allows execution from RAM.
Would you like a full working example or linker script for this setup? Or are you targeting a specific microcontroller (e.g., STM32, NXP, etc.)?
